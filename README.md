Modified version of Simple Mjpeg-streaming viewer for android (https://github.com/rushtehrani/simplemjpegview)

I was looking for a open source MJPEG viewer for my android to view my Motion Stream* and i found and modified the Simple Mjpeg-streaming viewer for android to suit my needs...
So i simplified the settings activity and implemented HTTP Authentication support to it. That's all for now.
