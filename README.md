Modified version of Simple Mjpeg-streaming viewer for android (https://github.com/rushtehrani/simplemjpegview)

I was looking for a open source MJPEG viewer for my android to view my Motion Stream* and i found and modified the Simple Mjpeg-streaming viewer for android to suit my needs...
So i simplified the settings activity and implemented HTTP Authentication support to it.
Then i modified Motion Widget (https://github.com/malcyL/MotionWidget) and merged it with my modified version of Simple Mjpeg-streaming viewer

That's all for now.
